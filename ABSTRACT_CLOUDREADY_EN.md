# Is my Java app ready for the cloud? When to rewrite, when to migrate and when to leave

The move to the cloud has become a crucial aspect for businesses, and Java applications are no exception.
However, many teams struggle to determine whether their existing Java applications are ready for the cloud, and if so, which approach to take: rewrite, migrate, or leave as is (and forget about it).
In this session, we will explore the considerations that must be taken into account when evaluating the cloud readiness of Java applications by examples running on traditional servers like OpenLiberty, WebSphere or JBoss.
We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, as well as the best practices for deciding which option to pursue. By the end of the presentation, attendees will have a better understanding of how to evaluate their Java applications for cloud readiness, and the best course of action to take to ensure a successful transition to the cloud.
I will take the Azure cloud as an example but it has the same relevance for other options.

I can do this session as a keynote in a high level format or in a half day workshop style with examples that can be found here:
