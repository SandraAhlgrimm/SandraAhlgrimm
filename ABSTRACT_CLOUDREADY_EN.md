# Is my Java app ready for the cloud? When to rewrite, when to migrate and when to leave

The move to the cloud has become a crucial aspect for businesses, and Java applications are no exception.
However, many teams struggle to determine whether their existing Java applications are ready for the cloud, and if so, which approach to take: rewrite, migrate, or leave as is (and forget about it).
In this session, we will explore the considerations that must be taken into account when evaluating the cloud readiness of Java applications by examples running on traditional app servers like OpenLiberty, WebSphere or JBoss.
Let's explore the fundamental aspects of cloud readiness including containerization and CI/CD.
We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, as well as the best practices for deciding which option to pursue. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a better understanding of how to evaluate their Java applications for cloud readiness, and the best course of action to take to ensure a successful transition to the cloud.

They are many ways to run Java on Azure. In this workshop, we'll give you an overview of all of them, and focus on App Service and Azure Kubernetes Service.
We aim for a production grade examples including infrastructure as code, CI/CD and performance monitoring.
The Kubernetes aspects of the workshop should also apply to other hyperscale Kubernetes offerings such as EKS, GKE, OKE.
