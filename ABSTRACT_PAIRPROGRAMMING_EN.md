# Unleash the power of AI in your every day coding

We all hate boilerplate code. Redundancy as well. Nobody likes repetitive tasks. Can AI help here? How useful is the AI integration in our IDE's these days?

Join me, live coding with GitHub CoPilot revealing its power and limits. I want to build production ready software without damaging the rules of complaint software of the enterprise company I am working for. And I won't do that alone. I will use CoPilot's guidance and smartness.



Are we getting more productive? What about security and privacy issues? What rules should we set to stay complaint?



At the end of this fun infotainment session all attendees are aware of the current capabilities of AI for their software coding and deployment. Furthermore, we will be experts of its limits and what rules need to be set for professional setups.
